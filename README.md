# 🗂️ Data Lighthouse
**Data Lighthouse** is an intelligent data validation and cleaning system designed to detect, flag, and correct errors in datasets before analysis or storage. It helps developers and organizations maintain **data integrity**, **accuracy**, and **consistency** through automated checks and smart reporting.
## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automated data validation for missing or inconsistent values
- 🧹 Data cleaning suggestions powered by rule-based logic and AI
- 📊 Summary reports showing validation results
- ⚙️ Easy integration with APIs and databases
- 🔒 Secure data handling with privacy in mind

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **FastAPI** (for building APIs)
- **Pandas** (for data processing and validation)
- **MongoDB** (for storing validated datasets)
- **Pydantic / Pandera** (for schema validation)
- **Docker (optional)** for deployment
- **GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)
## 💡 How It Works
1. Upload or input raw data into the system.
2. The system applies validation rules automatically.
3. Errors and inconsistencies are detected and logged.
4. Data is cleaned and restructured for storage.
5. Results are displayed in an easy-to-read validation report.
6. The cleaned dataset is stored in **MongoDB** or exported as a CSV file.
## 📦 Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/lighthouse.git
cd lighthouse
Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:
python app/main.py
Access the FastAPI interface:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
## 🧠 Example Use Case
Imagine you receive a CSV file full of sales data, but some records are missing prices or dates. Data Lighthouse automatically scans, validates, and cleans that file — producing a report showing what was fixed or flagged. You can then save the cleaned data in MongoDB or download it for analysis.
## 📚 Future Plans
- Add AI-assisted rule generation for smarter validation
- Build a dashboard to visualize data quality metrics
- Integrate with cloud data services (like Azure Blob or AWS S3)
- Add real-time alerts for data anomalies
